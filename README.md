[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/fastx-barber/) | [docs](https://ggirelli.github.io/fastx-barber/)

A Python3.8+ package to trim and extract flags from FASTA  and FASTQ files.

## Features (in short)

* Works on both FASTA and FASTQ files.
* Selects reads based on a pattern (regex).
* Trims reads by pattern (regex), length, or single-base quality.
* Extracts parts (flags) of reads based on a pattern and stores them in the read headers.
* [Generates BED file with the locations of a substring](https://ggirelli.github.io/fastx-barber/usage#find-sequence) in FASTX records.
* Regular expression support [*fuzzy* matching](https://pypi.org/project/regex/#approximate-fuzzy-matching-hg-issue-12-hg-issue-41-hg-issue-109) (*fuzzy matching* might affect the barber's speed).
* Parallelizes processing by splitting the fastx file in chunks.
